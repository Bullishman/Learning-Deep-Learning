        "In the example, id(string) refers to the tokenized index of the string, and one_hot_id is the one-hot encoded version of the index. We have assumed that the longest source sentence is six words, so we padded src_input to be of that length. Similarly, we have assumed that the longest destination sentence is eight words including START and STOP tokens, so we padded both dest_input and dest_target to be of that length. Note how the symbols in dest_input are offset by one location compared to the symbols in dest_target because when we later do inference, the inputs into the decoder network will be coming from the output of the network for the previous timestep. Although this example has shown the training example as being lists, in reality, they will be rows in NumPy arrays, where each array contains multiple training examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "The padding is done to ensure that we can use mini-batches for training. That is, all source sentences need to be the same length, and all destination sentences need to be the same length. We pad the source input at the beginning (known as prepadding) and the destination at the end (known as postpadding), which is nonobvious.\n",
        "\n",
        "We previously stated that when using padding, the model can learn to ignore the padded values. However, as always, things are not as simple as they might appear. Although the model can learn to ignore values, it will not perfectly learn this. The ease with which it learns to ignore padding values might depend on how the data is arranged. It is not hard to imagine that inputting a considerable number of zeros at the end of a sequence will dilute the input and affect the internal state of the network. From that perspective, it makes sense to pad the input values with zeros in the beginning of the sequence instead. Similarly, in a sequence-to-sequence network, if the encoder has created an internal state that is transferred to the decoder, diluting this state by presenting a number of zeros before the START token also seems like it could be bad. This reasoning supports the chosen padding (prepadding of the source input and postpadding of the destination input).\n",
        "\n",
        "The code snippet below shows a compact way of creating the three arrays that we need. The first two lines create two new lists, each containing the destination sequences but the first (dest_target_token_seq) also augmented with STOP_INDEX after each sequence and the second (dest_input_token_seq) augmented with both START_INDEX and STOP_INDEX. It is easy to miss that dest_input_token_seq has a STOP_INDEX, but that falls out naturally because it is created from the dest_target_token_seq for which a STOP_INDEX was just added to each sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we call pad_sequences() on both the original src_input_data list (of lists) and on these two new destination lists. The pad_sequences() function pads the sequences with the PAD value and then returns a NumPy array. The default behavior of pad_sequences is to do prepadding, and we do that for the source sequence but explicitly ask for postpadding for the destination sequences.\n",

We then use this internal state as a starting point for the decoder to generate a translation, using the START token as input for the first time step. The loop that generates the translation is very similar to the code in c12e1_autocomplete_embedding. After all, the decoder is no different than a language model that generates a sentence based on an encoder-generated initial state representing the sentence to translate. The loop iterates until the model produces a STOP token or until a given number of words have been produced. Finally, we convert the produced tokenized sequences into the corresponding word sequences and print them out.\n",
