To enable us to easily one-hot encode each character, we want to assign a monotonically increasing index to each character. This is done by first creating a list of unique characters. Once we have that list, we can loop over it and assign an incrementing index to each character. We do this twice to create one dictionary (a hash table) that maps from character to index and a reverse dictionary from index to character. These will come in handy later when we want to convert text into one-hot encoded input to the network as well as when we want to convert one-hot encoded output into characters. Finally, we initialize a variable encoding_width with the count of unique characters, which will be the width of each one-hot encoded vector that represents a character."

        "The next step is to implement the beam search algorithm to predict text. Consult the section \"Beam Search\" in Chapter 11 for more details about beam search. In our implementation, each beam is represented by a tuple with three elements. The first element is the logarithm of the cumulative probability for the current sequence of characters. The second element is the string of characters. The third element is a one-hot encoded version of the string of characters. A reasonable question is why we store the logarithm of the cumulative probability instead of just the cumulative probability. Given that these probabilities are small, there is a risk that the limited precision of computer arithmetic results in underflow. This is addressed by instead computing the logarithm of the probability, in which case the multiplication is converted to an addition. For a small number of words, this is not necessary, but we do it anyway for good practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "We start by creating a single beam with an initial sequence of characters ('the body ') and set the initial probability to 1.0. The one-hot encoded version of the string is created by the first loop. We add this beam to a list named beams.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is followed by a nested loop that uses the trained model to do predictions according to the beam-search algorithm. We extract the one-hot encoding representation of each beam and create a NumPy array with multiple input examples. There is one input example per beam. During the first iteration, there is only a single input example. During the remaining iterations, there will be BEAM_SIZE number of examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "We convert the input to a tensor, move to the GPU and feed to the model. We also need to explicitly apply softmax to the output because the softmax operation is not included in the model itself. This results in one softmax vector per beam. The softmax vector contains one probability per word in the vocabulary. For each beam, we create BEAM_SIZE new beams, each beam consisting of the words from the original beam concatenated with one more word. We choose the most probable words when creating the beams. The probability for each beam can be computed by multiplying the current probability of the beam by the probability for the added word.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once we have created BEAM_SIZE beams for each existing beam, we sort the list of new beams according to their probabilities. We then discard all but the top BEAM_SIZE beams. This represents the pruning step. For the first iteration, this does not result in any pruning because we started with a single beam, and this beam resulted in just BEAM_SIZE beams. For all remaining iterations, we will end up with BEAM_SIZE * BEAM_SIZE beams and discard most of them.\n",
        "\n",
        "The loop runs for a fixed number of iterations followed by printing out the generated predictions. See the section \"Programming Example: Using LSTM for Text Autocompletion\" in Chapter 12 for examples of generated predictions that an equivalent TensorFlow implementation generated.\n"
